# GP20-2021.0413-BoolNumber
BoolNumber-Assignment

Implement the `BoolNumber`-Class as required by the documentation.
Use the `Program`-Class to test your implementation.

Bonus-Assignments:
- Implement an `Indexer` (the `[]`-operator).
- Implement mathematical operators `+`, `-`.
- Implement comparison operators `==`, `!=` `<`, `<=`, `>`, `>=`
- Implement `Exception`-handling for positive and negative (unintended) overflows. (This trains error handling skills)
- Write Unit Tests for your implementation. (You should actually do this anyways)
- Implement the `IEnumerable`-interface. (It would make a lot of sense for a class like this, to allow easier enumeration over the bits)
- Implement an alternative implementation using a `struct` instead of a `class` (It would make much more sense in this case)
